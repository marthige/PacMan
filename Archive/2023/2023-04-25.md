* Homework
  * Make the pacman move in the array cells:
  1) Find the current coordinates of the pacman
  2) Make him move in some direction based on the clicked arrow 
        1. By changing his coordinates
        2. Check what cell he is in and restrict his movement in the array (not on the 0s)
        3. Based on the current coordinates console log his current cell in the array ([i,j])
