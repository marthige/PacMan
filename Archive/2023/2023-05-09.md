* Today
  * Think about how to make the pacman eat the dots he goes through (every dot has the same distance from its correlating empty space in the empty map on the spritesheet)
    -> put the empty map on top of the dotted one
    -> read how to write divs with javascript


* Mantra
  * Divide and conquer.
  * Keep and archive the diary.
  * Prepare to share screen and code while others are watching (one day) ;)
  * Pull before work.
  * Make small steps.

* Homework/next steps
  * -> read how to write divs with javascript
  * -> choose a cell and replace it with an empty one
  * -> find the current coordinates
  * -> replace the recent cell with its correlating empty one
