* Today
  * made the ghost turn right when he hits a wall or the opposite if he can't go left
  * researched the random function
  * made the ghost turn all the other directions except a wall when he goes on a cross-section with randomly choosing '1' or '2'


* Mantra
  * Divide and conquer.
  * Keep and archive the diary.
  * Prepare to share screen and code while others are watching (one day) ;)
  * Pull before work.
  * Make small steps.

  * -> make the big dots influence everyone
