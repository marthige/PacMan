* Today
  * fixed the ghost moves by removing the == for changing the direction and removing the first check if it hits a wall - instead checking for a cross-section and then a wall(both with random variants)
  * made a check variable so it checks only one 'if' per cycle

* Mantra
  * Divide and conquer.
  * Keep and archive the diary.
  * Prepare to share screen and code while others are watching (one day) ;)
  * Pull before work.
  * Make small steps.
